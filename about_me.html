    <h3>Trip Recap: Portland, ME</h3>
    
    In May 2023, two of my good friends were getting married and had a joint bachelor/bacherlette event in Portland, ME.
    Their best man and maid of honor set up a website to run a scavenger hunt of between the groom's party and the bride's party.
    It consisted of different activities through the city that required us to travel to notable locations and try cool local experiences.
    We went to the islands of the coast to dip our toes in the water, ask a local directions to the Portland Zoo, and visit the world's only umbrella cover museaum.
    Highlights of the trip were definately the duck fat poutine, food trucks by the water, and the getting together at the end to share the different experiences.

<h3>Favorite Restaurant</h3>
<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/twin-donuts-allston" target="_blank">Twin Donuts</a> is the ONLY diner I've found in Boston that fully lives up to my diner ideals.
Some people would call it 'no-frills'. Personally this is just the only way a diner should ever be.
You can get a good breadfast sandwich for $5. That is the correct price caliber for a breakfast sandwhich.
The staff is friendly, they have coffee refills, and the donuts can be actually dunked in coffee since they're cake donuts and not yeasted.
I used to live a block a way and moved in 2017 and have missed Twin Donuts more than I could have dreamed. I will always love you, Twin Donuts.

THIS is the correct amount a scallop should be seared. It can be tough to get without overcooking the scallop. You have to start with a hot pan.
You have to use an oil with a high enough smoke point, so you can't use butter without burning it.
You only have one chance on the flip, so be patient enough to get a good color without walking away from the pan.

      <td>Seth Dickinson</td>      
      <td>A hard fantasy novel following the life of Baru Cormorant, who grows up on the island Taranoke recently subjected to the influences of an imperial power of Falcrest via annexation.
        Baru grows up as a savant in the imperial education system, and seeks to gain political power as a foreigner after being placed as an accountant in a area of unrest.
        It's a great series that covers the way encratism creates self-policing to work with an overtaking economic power, cultural isolation, repression, and the nature of economics are used to create subsidiary colonies out of independent states. 
        It can be very crushing to read through but is a highly complex yet cogent set of novels that challenges the protagonist and reader throughout.

        <td>N.K. Jemisin</td>
        <td>This is the first of the 'Broken Earth' trilogy. It is set in a post-apocalyptic Earth, where certain people have essentially the ability to 
            create earthquakes/energy - Orogenes. This power is what caused the apocalypse and the continued 'seasons' of desolation and starvation. This forces the Orogene to be aggressively hated by the surviving people, and the necessity to use the powers to stabilize areas yielded a training system.
            The first novel follows three characters in the world:
            Essun - whose husband murdered her child when he found out he was an Orogene and stole their daughter.
            Damaya - a child being sent to Fulcrum to train. 
            Syenite - an adult from Fulcrum leaving to city with a higher member of the system.

            A very brutal novel with a well realized world building and characters.

Lsel is a smaller satellite, but has the cultural practices to carry the memory of a lineage through a neurological implant. Mahit has the outdated memories of the previous Lsel ambassador as she investigates his murder that occurred shortly before arriving.
            Itâ€™s a fantastic book with a unique construction of a society based on narrative as its primary cultural value. Mahit struggles with being raised to value Teixcalaanli culture as a pinnicle of civilization while never being able to being a true part of it while navigating a complex political web of succession to the dying emperor of Teixcalann.

            Great read for those familiar with everydays of scientific research.
