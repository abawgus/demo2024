    <h1>Alyssa B</h1>

I was interested in this class since it had been ~10 years since I did any web programming and I wanted to sharpen my skills.
Most of what I've done has been on company intranets only. I haven't had to deal with actual web hosting before, and wanted go through the process.
I also haven't learned Node.js, and saw it was on the ciriculum.

<p>Software-wise, I primarily do python development in my work, and manage a desktop app for supporting the service lab where I work.
I've also did some web development in PHP for a test management site for a failure analysis lab in 2014, and various other small personal projects beforehand.
